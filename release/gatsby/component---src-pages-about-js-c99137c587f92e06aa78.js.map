On this website you can find musical compositions performed\n            by wonderful musicians from YouTube. Each composition is split onto segments and binded to the sheet music, so\n            you could listen and study it bit by bit.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            You could also split ANY YouTube video that you'd like (see Editor) and play it back later by segments\n            (see Player). If the work is qualitative and the sheet music is in the public domain, you are very welcome\n            to contribute to the project and add this composition to the website (see how to do that).\n            Before doing that, please make sure you are not infringing any copyrights.\n        </p>\n    </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default NotFoundPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
